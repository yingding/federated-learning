# Introduction
this repository contains code examples for federated learning with Python3 programming language and TensorFlow Federated (TFF)

## Make a VENV with pip3

#### Create a VENV
```console
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

#### Activate a VENV in console
```console
source </path/to/new/virtual/environment>/bin/activate

```

#### Deactivate a VENV in console
```console
(/your/venv): deactivate
```

## Export and Import Libs for TFF 

#### export libs from virtual env
```console
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

#### import libs into the VENV
```console
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
